## The problem Paperly solves

Centralized blogging platforms like Medium and Substack have become popular in recent years, but they come with several limitations and problems that hinder the growth and freedom of creators. One of the biggest issues is the lack of control that creators have over their content. These platforms can take down or ban content they don't like, leaving creators without a voice. Additionally, creators are often paid less than what they deserve since the platform takes a significant cut of the revenue generated by content creators.


## Solution
To address these issues, we're building a decentralized blogging infrastructure on Flow blockchain that provides creators with full control over their content. By using IPFS for content storage, our platform ensures that content is immutable and tamper-proof. Creators can set their own rules and earn directly from their content without intermediaries taking a cut.

## Features 

- Full control over content: Our platform allows creators to publish their content directly on the Flow blockchain using IPFS, providing complete control and ownership over their content.
- Secure and transparent: Our platform uses smart contracts to ensure that content cannot be altered or deleted, providing an added layer of security and transparency.
- Monetization options: Creators can earn revenue through multiple monetization options, including paid subscriptions (coming soon), donations, and pay-per-view models.
- Verified identities: Our integration with the .find platform on Flow chain ensures that all users have a verified identity and reputation within the Flow ecosystem.
- User-friendly interface: Our platform has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for creators to publish and monetize their content, and for users to discover new creators and engage with their content.
